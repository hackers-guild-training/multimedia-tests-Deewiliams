12
00:00:57,815 --> 00:00:59,147
I gotta open up the shop.

Kenny, you're leaving us one short.

Like y'all ain't gonna
be at the shop later,

15
00:01:02,742 --> 00:01:04,142
begging to fit you in
for a lineup, right?

16
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:07,212
Hey, stroller guy, you want to run?

17
00:01:07,246 --> 00:01:08,246
Me?

18
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:11,316
Oh, sorry. Baby.

19
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:12,629
I'll watch your baby.

20
00:01:12,664 --> 00:01:14,319
Uh...

21
00:01:14,354 --> 00:01:16,221
No, no, that's okay. I don't want to...

22
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:17,322
I babysit all the time.

23
00:01:17,357 --> 00:01:19,191
You got no reason not to play.

24
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,493
Uh...

25
00:01:21,527 --> 00:01:22,983
really?

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,334

33
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:43,448
Did I mention I have cancer?

34
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:45,217
Hey, stroller guy, I hope you pass

35
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:47,519
some serious math skills onto this baby.

We'll get that back.

Sorry, guys, I got to... duty calls.

46
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,559
- Aww.
- Fun's over.

47
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:30,796
You might not be able
to shoot, stroller guy,

48
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,397
but look at Marquis.

49
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:34,566
You definitely had him
running up and down the court.

50
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,101
It was fun.

51
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:37,180
Yeah, man, good playing with you, man.

52
00:02:37,214 --> 00:02:38,308
You, too.

53
00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:40,372
Hey, thanks.

54
00:02:42,842 --> 00:02:44,142
First time playing basketball?

55
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:45,477
No way.

56
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:48,380
Two years YMCA rec league. Basically pro.

57
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,584
Daddy's got mad skills, right?

58
00:02:52,618 --> 00:02:55,153
- Don't listen to them.
- Dad, are you okay?

59
00:02:58,491 --> 00:02:59,458
- Dad!
- Rod, grab the stroller.

60
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:01,426
Marquis!

61
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:02,494
Give me some space.

62
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,099

32-year-old man found down.

65
00:03:13,673 --> 00:03:15,607
No pulse, no respirations.

66
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:17,275
Cardiac resuscitation
started immediately.

67

Get the defibrillator ready.

68
00:03:18,678 --> 00:03:20,345
He was sweating profusely
as he boxed me out

69
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:21,847
- in our pickup game.
- Your pickup game?

70
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:23,448
Why does no on believe I can play?

71
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:24,883
Is he gonna be okay?

72
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:26,284
Yeah, just come with me.

73
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,619
Nuh-uh. I'm going in with him.

74
00:03:27,653 --> 00:03:29,120
I need you to stay here.

75
00:03:29,155 --> 00:03:31,323
Just tell me plain.
Is my dad gonna be okay?

76
00:03:31,357 --> 00:03:33,458
You watched over my daughter,

77
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:36,461
and we're gonna watch over your dad.

78
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:37,662
Okay?

79
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:44,636
First, I divide the pleura
to isolate the diaphragm.

80
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,472
Then, with forceps
applying gentle traction,

81
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:49,908
I plicate the paralyzed area
using a series of U-sutures.

82
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:51,243
Where are those anchored?

83
00:03:51,277 --> 00:03:53,245
Costal arch of the sixth rib.

84
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:54,546
I also dug deep and found

85
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,215
a completely endoscopic approach.

86
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,930
No partial thoracotomy?

87
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,486
Since when? That's not how I trained.

88
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:03,221
You got some reading to do.

89
00:04:04,524 --> 00:04:06,438
Damn, Duke,
you're putting me on the ropes.

90
00:04:10,296 --> 00:04:12,898
I'm just, I'm so mad at myself right now.

91
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:14,533
So much for telling you my news.

92
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:17,269
We have four children under 10 already.

93
00:04:17,303 --> 00:04:18,503
But, no, I have to suggest to Martin

94
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:20,505
that we adopt another one. Why?

95
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,508
What am I doing? Why do I always do this?

96
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:25,544
But it's like if you see
a squirrel in the park

97
00:04:25,578 --> 00:04:27,512
and it's injured, or, like,
a pigeon with a bum wing

98
00:04:27,547 --> 00:04:29,276
or whatever, do you not try to rescue it?

99
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:30,450
No.

100
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:31,640
You don't? I do.

101
00:04:31,665 --> 00:04:34,185
That's, like, my go-to.
I just can't help myself.

102
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,288
But Martin, you know,
you should've seen the look

103
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:38,523
on his face this morning,
Vijay, it was like...

104
00:04:38,558 --> 00:04:40,358
I don't know.
What's a word that means angry

105
00:04:40,393 --> 00:04:42,227
but also profoundly exasperated?

106
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:43,528
English is not my first language, but...

107
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:46,231
I see these kids in the refugee camps,

108
00:04:46,265 --> 00:04:47,399
and I see the looks on their faces,

109
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:49,234
and it's a no-brainer for me.

110
00:04:49,268 --> 00:04:52,704
We have money, we have space,
we... Martin... ugh, Martin.

111
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:54,239
No, Martin's right. Martin's right.

112
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:56,274
Martin is always right.

113
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:57,576
We have a full family as is,

114
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,403
and there are tons of other ways to help.

115
00:04:59,437 --> 00:05:00,523
Thank you.

116
00:05:00,558 --> 00:05:01,947
Thank you for talking
me through this, Vijay.

117
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:04,482
I appreciate it.
Now hit me with the good news.

118
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:05,650
What's going on?

119
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:07,686
We are having a baby.

120
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:10,722
What?

121
00:05:10,756 --> 00:05:12,991
Are you seeing someone?

122
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:15,493
Not me, but Ella,
she's carrying my grandchild.

123
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:17,729
Can you believe it?

124
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:19,337
No, not even a little bit.

125
00:05:19,371 --> 00:05:20,465
At first, it was all bad,

126
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:23,401
but what choice do I have
but to take it as a blessing?

127
00:05:23,436 --> 00:05:25,725
I can't stop smiling.

128
00:05:30,643 --> 00:05:32,577
Are you okay?

129
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:34,446
We're having a baby.

130
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,590
We're having a baby!

00:05:47,393 --> 00:05:49,327
You know what? I never thought of that.

On a scale of one to ten,
how's your pain level?

139
00:06:00,806 --> 00:06:01,806
A hard one.

140
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:03,321
Sounds more like...

141
00:06:03,355 --> 00:06:04,476
Oh, you got me.

142
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,012
Yeah, my pain level is jazz hands.

143
00:06:07,046 --> 00:06:08,780
You know what? even if you are right,

144
00:06:08,814 --> 00:06:11,783
and I am in otherworldly pain,

I've got physical therapy
right after work.

That's in nine hours.
Why don't you see if Ligon

147
00:06:16,489 --> 00:06:18,023
can squeeze you in for a quick session?

148

Hm?

150
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:37,342
What's wrong?

151
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:39,077
This time, I should be on top.

152
00:06:41,614 --> 00:06:44,482
I, of course, say that
from a therapeutic standpoint.

153
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:48,319
Ms. Richards.

154
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:49,654
Welcome to New Amsterdam.

155
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,656
Thrilled to be here.

156
00:06:51,691 --> 00:06:54,426
Yeah, so I understand
that you were previously

157
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,661
at Mount Zion under Dr. Castro.

158
00:06:56,696 --> 00:06:59,097
Yes. I'm embarrassed to ask you,

159
00:06:59,131 --> 00:07:02,113
but would mind?

160
00:07:02,702 --> 00:07:06,071
Could you just write,
"Warm regards, Molly?"

161
00:07:06,105 --> 00:07:07,772
Of course.

162
00:07:07,807 --> 00:07:09,874
It's an old co-worker.

163
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:13,845
We recently lost a mutual friend.

164
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,714
I can't grip the... ow.

165
00:07:15,748 --> 00:07:17,749
It's not a problem. There you go.

166
00:07:17,783 --> 00:07:19,350
Thank you, dear.

167
00:07:19,385 --> 00:07:21,686
I'm Dr. Sharpe. I run the oncology...

168
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:26,357
Dr. Castro and I head the department.

169
00:07:26,392 --> 00:07:29,627
I'm glad to see women
are running things here, too.

170
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:32,435
I was a partner at Goldman and Fitch.

171
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:36,101
Investment banking Impressive.

172
00:07:36,135 --> 00:07:37,702
I have a number
of patients in that field.

173
00:07:37,737 --> 00:07:39,704
Almost all are men.

174
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:43,530
We gals, as they called us,
were about one in ten.

175
00:07:44,176 --> 00:07:46,778
It was great fun, before I was sidelined

176
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:48,480
by this stupid disease.

177
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:50,615
I can see you're in a lot of pain.

178
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:52,717
Dr. Castro warned me this latest

179
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:56,001
experimental agent might be rough.

180
00:07:56,956 --> 00:07:58,920
How many have you tried?

181
00:07:59,925 --> 00:08:02,078
I don't know. Seven.

182
00:08:05,931 --> 00:08:07,565
How you feeling?

183
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,467
I was gonna make
a Floyd Mayweather reference,

184
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:10,902
but I don't think sports is your thing.

185
00:08:10,936 --> 00:08:12,604
He was a boxer.

186
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:14,672
Oh, was he? Thank you for that.

187
00:08:14,707 --> 00:08:17,909
Uh, Marquis, you have a heart
that's been working overtime.

188
00:08:17,943 --> 00:08:19,744
Do you know you have hypertension?

189
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:21,110
Of course my blood pressure's up.

190
00:08:21,145 --> 00:08:22,480
I'm in the damn hospital.

191
00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:24,149
You get me outside,
it's a different story.

192
00:08:24,183 --> 00:08:26,618
Well, it's high blood pressure
that brought you in here.

193
00:08:26,652 --> 00:08:27,919
That's impossible.

194
00:08:27,953 --> 00:08:29,921
I exercise every day. I eat healthy.

195
00:08:29,955 --> 00:08:31,790
Your condition's been
developing for some time.

196
00:08:31,824 --> 00:08:33,958
When's the last time you that
had a checkup or a physical?

197
00:08:33,993 --> 00:08:35,660
Not since I've been alive.

198
00:08:35,694 --> 00:08:38,596
Why go to the doctor when you're healthy?

199
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:40,698
Best time to go to the doctor
is before you get sick.

200
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,433
Blood sugar checks, cancer screenings...

201
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:44,636
And the added benefit of missing work?

202
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:47,939
How many guys I met today

203
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:49,741
have the same policy on doctors?

204
00:08:50,976 --> 00:08:51,976
All of them.

205
00:09:03,222 --> 00:09:04,334
Hi, there.

206
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:05,690
Stroller guy.

207
00:09:05,724 --> 00:09:08,793
Yeah. Also known as Dr. Max Goodwin.

208
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:09,961
Dr. G.

209
00:09:09,995 --> 00:09:11,196
That's cooler. Let's go with that.

210
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,831
Kenny.

211
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:14,305
Thanks for helping my boy Quis out.

212
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,501
- Sure.
- How's he doing?

213
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:19,204
It's tough to say,
but just glad I was there.

214
00:09:19,238 --> 00:09:21,206
Marquis is one of my best customers.

215
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,974
How about I give you
a trim free of charge?

216
00:09:23,008 --> 00:09:24,676
You know what? I actually...

217
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,978
I have a free service for you.

218
00:09:27,012 --> 00:09:28,613
What kind of service?

219
00:09:30,616 --> 00:09:31,749
What do you think about Kenny's Kuts

220
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:34,018
having its own in-house physician?

221
00:09:40,237 --> 00:09:41,836
So you want to set up in my shop?

222
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:44,539
Uh, yeah. I want to give
consultations to your customers,

223
00:09:44,573 --> 00:09:46,274
free of charge.

224
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:48,209
Yeah, but, like, here?
Like, inside the shop?

225
00:09:48,244 --> 00:09:49,277
Right here.

226
00:09:49,794 --> 00:09:53,548
Look, Doc, the only cutting that
goes on inside this clinic is hair.

227
00:09:53,582 --> 00:09:55,708
Look, Marquis is your customer, right?

228
00:09:55,743 --> 00:09:58,553
He just had a cardiac emergency
due to unchecked hypertension.

229
00:09:58,587 --> 00:10:01,356
But what if he had a doctor
checking his blood pressure

230
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,825
every so often, say,
every time he gets a haircut?

231
00:10:03,859 --> 00:10:05,326
I feel you, but what makes you think

232
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:06,899
all of my customers need help?

233
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:09,063
Three in four African
American men develop

234
00:10:09,098 --> 00:10:11,152
high blood pressure by the age of 55,

235
00:10:11,186 --> 00:10:15,056
and are twice as likely
to die from cardiac disease.

236
00:10:16,272 --> 00:10:18,640
I don't know, man. Not buying it.

237
00:10:18,674 --> 00:10:21,209
Look, it's not gonna
cost you a thing, all right?

238
00:10:21,243 --> 00:10:23,088
Once a week,
I'll spend an hour in the back,

239
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,345
and if anybody wants

240
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,247
to get their blood pressure
checked, I'm here.

241
00:10:26,282 --> 00:10:28,383
And if it's high, I give them a pill.

242
00:10:28,736 --> 00:10:30,151
What you think, man?

243
00:10:30,186 --> 00:10:31,419
I don't know.

244
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:35,089
White guy in the back, handing out pills?

245
00:10:35,124 --> 00:10:36,658
That doesn't look too good.

246
00:10:39,122 --> 00:10:40,328
What's in it for you?

247
00:10:40,362 --> 00:10:42,430
I won't have to watch
another 14-year-old girl

248
00:10:42,465 --> 00:10:44,232
think her dad just died.

249
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:45,600
<i>♪ By standing on the wall</i>

250
00:10:45,634 --> 00:10:47,335
<i>♪ Get your back up off the wall ♪</i>

251
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:49,103
<i>♪ 'Cause I heard all the people saying ♪</i>

252
00:10:49,138 --> 00:10:51,339
Okay.

253
00:10:51,373 --> 00:10:52,874
Mrs. Martone?

254
00:10:52,908 --> 00:10:54,442
Tessa.

255
00:10:54,477 --> 00:10:55,877
And this is Xander.

256
00:10:55,911 --> 00:10:57,178
Hey, Xander.

257
00:10:57,213 --> 00:10:58,613
My name is Dr. Bloom,

258
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:00,515
and this here is Casey.

259
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:02,684
Do you mind if I take
a look at your head?

260
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:08,590
Ooh. Okay, that is what
us doctors call a doozy,

261
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:11,593
but it's nothing
a few stitches can't fix.

262
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:14,529
So how'd this happen?

263
00:11:15,431 --> 00:11:16,792
He was doing his homework

264
00:11:16,826 --> 00:11:18,700
when he started to get frustrated.

265
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:20,902
Next thing I knew...

266
00:11:20,936 --> 00:11:22,904
he was standing and banging
his head against the wall.

267
00:11:28,944 --> 00:11:30,578
Can we get Dr. Frome down here?

268
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,058
So here's the damaged area of your heart.

269
00:11:40,523 --> 00:11:42,490
Now there are two options.

270
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:44,659
We can tuck an internal
defibrillator just under skin

271
00:11:44,693 --> 00:11:46,548
to shock the heart back
into normal rhythm

272
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:47,779
when it goes out of control,

273
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:50,431
or we can perform surgery
and take out the part

274
00:11:50,466 --> 00:11:51,499
of your heart that's causing the problem.

275
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:53,334
I was fine this morning.

276
00:11:53,369 --> 00:11:55,236
Now you want to cut into me?

277
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:58,439
Look, I'm a single father with
a daughter to take care of.

278
00:11:58,474 --> 00:12:00,954
Who's gonna take care of me
after open-heart surgery?

279
00:12:01,677 --> 00:12:03,177
I won't be a burden to her.

280
00:12:03,212 --> 00:12:05,547
Wait, wait, hold up, hold up, hold up.

281
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:11,339
Might be another option.

282
00:12:12,488 --> 00:12:14,309
So you will wear this all the time.

283
00:12:14,343 --> 00:12:15,509
Even in the shower?

284
00:12:15,544 --> 00:12:17,692
While you're sleeping,
eating, exercising, everything.

285
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:19,360
Now your monitor's gonna
transmit your heart rhythm

286
00:12:19,395 --> 00:12:20,648
back here to the hospital.

287
00:12:20,683 --> 00:12:23,466
If there's any more troubling rhythms,
the hospital will know about it,

288
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:25,600
and we'll be able to coordinate a
response to the GPS in the device.

289
00:12:25,634 --> 00:12:27,697
Marquis, glad you're feeling better.

290
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:29,345
- Thanks, Dr. Goodwin.
- Yeah, just so you know,

291
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,772
you can get full health care
from me at Kenny's Kuts.

292
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:31,906
Wait, what?

293
00:12:31,941 --> 00:12:34,153
Yeah, I got a chair in the back.
I'll see you there.

294
00:12:34,643 --> 00:12:36,573
Why would...

295
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:42,717
Valentina, I've just met Molly Richards.

296
00:12:42,751 --> 00:12:44,352
Dry as a martini, isn't she?

297
00:12:45,054 --> 00:12:46,554
She's suffering.

298
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:48,323
She's been through a lot,

299
00:12:48,357 --> 00:12:49,991
but she's a trooper.

300
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:52,794
She mentioned how she's
on her seventh drug regimen.

301
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:54,562
She's gone through all kinds
of medications

302
00:12:54,597 --> 00:12:56,331
that haven't even hit the market yet,

303
00:12:56,365 --> 00:12:57,532
even phase one trials.

304
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,242
So the drugs you're giving her

305
00:13:00,276 --> 00:13:01,979
are only to see if people
can tolerate them?

306
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:03,366
That sounds like a judgment.

307
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,472
If she's suffering this badly

308
00:13:04,506 --> 00:13:06,040
and you don't even know if they work...

309
00:13:06,075 --> 00:13:08,409
Molly's been breaking
barriers her entire life,

310
00:13:08,444 --> 00:13:10,678
so even now, with incurable cancer,

311
00:13:10,713 --> 00:13:13,514
she gains satisfaction
from pioneering new treatments.

312
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:15,016
Gives her meaning to her struggle.

313
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:18,239
Mm. And it advances your career.

314
00:13:19,054 --> 00:13:20,488
Excuse me?

315
00:13:20,522 --> 00:13:23,161
Are these treatments helping her, or you?

316
00:13:24,793 --> 00:13:26,414
Helen...

317
00:13:27,596 --> 00:13:29,497
she's my patient.

318
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:37,038
Hello. Hi.

319
00:13:37,072 --> 00:13:39,540
Hi, Xander. My name is Dr. Frome.

320
00:13:39,575 --> 00:13:43,444
I heard that you did a real
number on your noggin there.

321
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,046
Ouch.

322
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,715
You think you can talk
to me about why you did it?

323
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:54,288
It's okay, sweetie.
Dr. Frome is here to help.

324
00:13:54,323 --> 00:13:55,690
Absolutely.

325
00:13:59,948 --> 00:14:00,982
I don't know.

326
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:06,734
No? That's okay.

327
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:08,603
Why don't you tell me what happened?

328
00:14:15,411 --> 00:14:17,131
I don't know. I just...

329
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,218
I just got mad, and then I was, like...

330
00:14:22,518 --> 00:14:24,222
Hurting myself.

331
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,555
Well, that must've been scary.

332
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:29,524
Have you gotten mad like that before?

333
00:14:31,927 --> 00:14:34,729
I've been frustrated before,
like, with school.

334
00:14:34,763 --> 00:14:35,797
Yeah.

335
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:37,732
My mom.

336
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:41,906
But never this bad.

337
00:14:42,638 --> 00:14:44,325
That's okay.

338
00:14:46,442 --> 00:14:47,875
It's okay, Xander.

339
00:14:51,513 --> 00:14:53,042
It's like...

340
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,652
I'm mad all the time.

341
00:14:57,686 --> 00:14:59,587
And I can't control it anymore.

342
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:03,691
I bet that's hard.

343
00:15:10,566 --> 00:15:12,366
Xander, has your hand
been shaking like that

344
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:13,868
since you hurt your head?

345
00:15:13,902 --> 00:15:15,636
It's been like that for a while.

346
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:26,547
You two take it easy here.
I'll be back in a bit, okay?

347
00:15:26,582 --> 00:15:28,583
All right.

348
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:35,490
Xander Martone has neurological damage.

349
00:15:35,524 --> 00:15:36,691
From his head injury?

350
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:39,861
No, worse. From before the head injury.

351
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:41,662
Okay, I'll run some tests,
and I'll page Kapoor.

352
00:15:41,697 --> 00:15:42,764
Okay.

353
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:47,535
Code.

354
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:48,836
V-fib, outpatient heart monitor,

355
00:15:48,871 --> 00:15:50,471
- Marquis Cannon.
- Damnit.

356
00:15:50,506 --> 00:15:52,118
Okay.

357
00:15:52,674 --> 00:15:54,642
Let me through. Make room.

358
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:57,689
He just stopped and fell.

359
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:19,604
- Hey, Kenny,
- Hm.

360
00:16:19,638 --> 00:16:21,749
What's up with Nurse Jackie down there?

361
00:16:21,783 --> 00:16:23,837
That's Dr. G, here on his lunch break.

362
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:25,872
So, what, you line me up,
and then Doogie Howser

363
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:28,208
down there amputates my leg or something?

364
00:16:28,242 --> 00:16:30,810
- What, take out my appendix?
- You know what, man?

365
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:33,213
I think barbers
actually used to do surgeries.

366
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:35,189
He's here for folks like
you who ain't been to a doctor

367
00:16:35,224 --> 00:16:36,516
in a month of Sundays.

368
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:38,485
Man, do I look like
I need to go to the doctor?

369
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,020
Hey, maybe I do.

370
00:16:40,054 --> 00:16:42,055
I mean, these pythons
is a little sick, you know?

371
00:16:43,594 --> 00:16:46,059
What about that time
you busted your elbow

372
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:47,127
falling off your bike?

373
00:16:47,161 --> 00:16:48,528
Man, I wrapped it myself.

374
00:16:48,563 --> 00:16:50,063
Let's check it out. My elbow fine.

375
00:16:50,097 --> 00:16:52,065
Yo, anybody who's seen your jumpshot

376
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:53,967
knows that's not true.

377
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:56,736
Okay, okay, okay, you got jokes.

378
00:16:56,771 --> 00:16:58,071
Man, shut up, man.

379
00:16:58,105 --> 00:16:59,839
It ain't like
you ever been to the doctor.

380
00:16:59,874 --> 00:17:02,075
Don't trust 'em. Never have, never will.

381
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:04,511
Look, guys, I know it's a little unusual,

382
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:07,047
but I'm just... I'm just trying to help.

383
00:17:07,081 --> 00:17:09,015
Doc, man, do yourself a favor,

384
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,517
and go find you some real sick patients,

385
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:12,052
like at a retirement home, huh?

386
00:17:13,605 --> 00:17:16,523
Actually, that's exactly
what I'm trying to do.

387
00:17:16,557 --> 00:17:17,991
Doc, you ain't getting it, man.

388
00:17:18,025 --> 00:17:19,489
Ain't none of us sick.

389
00:17:19,524 --> 00:17:20,729
Um...

390
00:17:20,764 --> 00:17:22,310
it's just that...

391
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:25,999
untreated malignant
hypertension can kill you,

392
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:29,269
and as African American men,
you're twice as likely to have it.

393
00:17:29,303 --> 00:17:31,171
And, Damian, I mean,
how do you know you don't have

394
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:32,939
a small hole in your heart right now?

395
00:17:32,974 --> 00:17:34,274
You know, I mean,
you could be sitting here,

396
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:35,735
chatting with your friends one minute,

397
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,733
and then the next, you've thrown a clot,

398
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,579
and you're having a stroke, you know?

399
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:42,082
Or, you, you could have
untreated type 2 diabetes,

400
00:17:42,116 --> 00:17:44,880
in which case, I really would
have to amputate that foot.

401
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:49,556
Aren't y'all supposed to have
bedside manner, or something?

402
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,558
Yeah, I know... I didn't
mean to kill the vibe in there.

403
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:53,193
I just got carried away, and I...

404
00:17:53,227 --> 00:17:55,261
My customers don't come here
to be threatened or shamed.

405
00:17:55,296 --> 00:17:56,863
Okay, especially by some stranger.

406
00:17:56,897 --> 00:17:57,897
I get it. It won't happen again.

407
00:17:57,932 --> 00:18:00,433
Yeah, no kidding,
'cause you're not coming back.

408
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:03,750
Fired in the first hour.
That's a new record.

409
00:18:11,312 --> 00:18:14,847
Okay, so something's
not working in my heart.

410
00:18:14,848 --> 00:18:16,549
That's clear.

411
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,584
What' this thing about the pacemaker?

412
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:19,819
That's the one that doesn't involve you

413
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:21,788
cracking open my chest, right?

414
00:18:21,822 --> 00:18:23,756
Right, but to be perfectly honest,

415
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,058
that option won't be curative.

416
00:18:25,092 --> 00:18:27,089
I want the pacemaker.

417
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:29,495
- I don't want surgery.
- Weak.

418
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,497
There's a doctor telling you to your face

419
00:18:31,532 --> 00:18:32,832
there's a good option and a weak option,

420
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:34,801
and you're going for the weak option,

421
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:36,002
'cause he just said the pacemaker is like

422
00:18:36,036 --> 00:18:38,071
the midrange jumper of medicine.

423
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:39,739
So do me a favor, Dad.

424
00:18:39,773 --> 00:18:41,607
Finish at the rim, or jack up a three.

425
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:43,509
Go for the cure or go home,
'cause I don't even want you

426
00:18:43,544 --> 00:18:45,578
in my house
if you're not gonna play right.

427
00:18:51,318 --> 00:18:53,586
Looks like I'm getting the surgery.

428
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,694
Okay, let's start him on Phenytoin.

429
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:04,030
850mg IV loading dose.

430
00:19:04,064 --> 00:19:06,420
Excuse me, have you seen Dr. Bloom?

431
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:09,836
Oh, you are not serious.

432
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,087
Oh, there you are.

433
00:19:11,121 --> 00:19:12,605
Yes.

434
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:14,807
Here I am on the floor
I am supposed to be on.

435
00:19:14,841 --> 00:19:16,042
Come with me.

436
00:19:24,084 --> 00:19:27,320
Okay. I know what's going on here.

437
00:19:27,354 --> 00:19:28,721
You do?

438
00:19:28,756 --> 00:19:31,657
Yes, I came to see you twice yesterday.

439
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:33,860
I was desperate and hurting and
I was having a good-hair day,

440
00:19:33,894 --> 00:19:35,328
and you thought maybe this

441
00:19:35,362 --> 00:19:36,729
would turn into the kind of arrangement

442
00:19:36,764 --> 00:19:37,897
where you could just pop down here

443
00:19:37,931 --> 00:19:39,565
any time you had an itch to scratch

444
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,900
and I would service you
in between patients.

445
00:19:40,934 --> 00:19:41,968
That's not...

446
00:19:42,002 --> 00:19:44,804
But this... hey, this is not
about sex for me.

447
00:19:44,838 --> 00:19:46,339
This is about managing my pain,

448
00:19:46,373 --> 00:19:49,942
and I come to you,
not the other way around.

449
00:19:55,616 --> 00:19:56,783
I need your help.

450
00:19:57,418 --> 00:19:58,718
How can I help?

451
00:19:58,752 --> 00:20:00,653
That's very good. Um...

452
00:20:00,687 --> 00:20:04,323
my first day at the barber shop
was not exactly a success.

453
00:20:04,357 --> 00:20:05,597
I got fired.

454
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:07,360
Yep. Saw that coming a mile away.

455
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:09,568
Did you? Thanks for saying something.

456
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:12,365
I was thinking maybe
you could give it a shot.

457
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:14,000
What makes you think I can do any better?

458
00:20:14,034 --> 00:20:17,703
Well, it's just,
you know, I think my particular

459
00:20:17,738 --> 00:20:20,773
complexion puts me at a slight
disadvantage, shall we say,

460
00:20:20,808 --> 00:20:24,877
that maybe you won't encounter
for various reasons.

461
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,747
- It's 'cause I'm black.
- It's because you're black, yeah.

462
00:20:27,781 --> 00:20:29,382
Right, and you want me to bail you out

463
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,684
with a group of people
who don't trust you.

464
00:20:31,718 --> 00:20:32,852
If you wouldn't mind.

465
00:20:32,886 --> 00:20:35,121
Except the problem isn't you.

466
00:20:35,155 --> 00:20:37,623
I mean, well, it's always just
a little bit of you, but...

467
00:20:37,658 --> 00:20:39,859
it's things like the Tuskegee
Syphilis Experiment.

468
00:20:39,893 --> 00:20:42,428
Henrietta Lacks, experimental
surgeries on slaves.

469
00:20:42,463 --> 00:20:44,063
Those kind of things
are the things that cause

470
00:20:44,097 --> 00:20:45,965
black people to take pause

471
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:49,101
whenever a doctor like yourself
comes around asking to help.

472
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:52,104
Yeah.

473
00:20:52,139 --> 00:20:54,140
What are you telling me, not to help?

474
00:20:54,174 --> 00:20:56,809
I'm telling you that it doesn't
matter who you send in there.

475
00:20:56,844 --> 00:20:58,945
They're not a part of their community,

476
00:20:58,979 --> 00:21:00,146
they're gonna be met with a block.

477
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,247
Right.

478
00:21:03,016 --> 00:21:03,983
Right.

479
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:05,418
Max, I know that face.

480
00:21:05,452 --> 00:21:06,752
Whatever you're thinking, don't.

481
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:07,854
Thank you.

482
00:21:24,872 --> 00:21:26,205
Dr. Sharpe.

483
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,396
Bearing gifts.

484
00:21:29,943 --> 00:21:31,777
If you're really
the head of the department,

485
00:21:31,812 --> 00:21:34,847
surely you have people
to do that for you.

486
00:21:34,882 --> 00:21:36,182
Co-head.

487
00:21:36,216 --> 00:21:38,572
And I like seeing patients.

488
00:21:40,287 --> 00:21:42,423
Make sure they're being
taken care of properly.

489
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:43,923
Control freak, huh?

490
00:21:45,329 --> 00:21:46,893
Me, too.

491
00:21:51,231 --> 00:21:53,032
Molly...

492
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:54,767
do you mind if I call you Molly?

493
00:21:54,801 --> 00:21:56,090
No.

494
00:21:56,537 --> 00:21:59,839
How did you lose your friend?
From the letter.

495
00:21:59,873 --> 00:22:01,774
Stupid accident.

496
00:22:03,076 --> 00:22:06,145
I confess. Part of me envies her.

497
00:22:08,982 --> 00:22:11,817
Life, fine.

498
00:22:11,852 --> 00:22:14,053
Death, at this point...

499
00:22:14,087 --> 00:22:15,855
fine, too.

500
00:22:18,158 --> 00:22:20,226
It's the middle ground,
waiting for death,

501
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,699
that's...

502
00:22:22,595 --> 00:22:24,196
humiliating.

503
00:22:29,002 --> 00:22:31,304
So why are you continuing
with the treatments?

504
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,509
Dr. Castro said my tumor
is a good one for study.

505
00:22:36,543 --> 00:22:40,212
Some genetic variant makes
it deliciously interesting.

506
00:22:40,247 --> 00:22:43,082
So you like being part of the process.

507
00:22:43,116 --> 00:22:44,817
You find it satisfying.

508
00:22:46,787 --> 00:22:47,853
I used to.

509
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,994
Molly.

510
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:01,000
Has Dr. Castro ever
talked to you about hospice?

511
00:23:01,969 --> 00:23:03,569
Hospice?

512
00:23:03,604 --> 00:23:05,200
The trial...

513
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,875
someone else is still
pulling the strings.

514
00:23:16,383 --> 00:23:20,419
I miss being in control, especially now.

515
00:23:22,155 --> 00:23:23,427
At the end.

516
00:23:29,096 --> 00:23:33,366
Your son's CT is clear.
That's the good news.

517
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,065
But his blood work revealed...

518
00:23:36,637 --> 00:23:39,372
extremely high levels of lead toxicity.

519
00:23:39,406 --> 00:23:41,111
Lead?

520
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:43,524
What does that mean?

521
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:45,311
Well, this level of exposure affected

522
00:23:45,345 --> 00:23:46,946
every one of Xander's organs.

523
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,048
It's the reason for the impulse control,

524
00:23:49,082 --> 00:23:51,683
the violent emotional swings,
also the hand tremors. All of it.

525
00:23:51,718 --> 00:23:54,153
But we caught it early.
We'll get him started

526
00:23:54,187 --> 00:23:56,322
- with the chelation therapy right away.
- Absolutely.

527
00:23:56,356 --> 00:23:58,057
How was he exposed?

528
00:23:58,091 --> 00:24:00,092
Most likely in your home.

529
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,161
But I have notified the city
to come out and test your home.

530
00:24:02,195 --> 00:24:06,098
Unfortunately, full disclosure,
they are a little backed up.

531
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:08,681
It could be a few months.

532
00:24:10,003 --> 00:24:11,170
So I'm supposed to go back home and just

533
00:24:11,204 --> 00:24:12,338
hope that it's safe?

534
00:24:12,372 --> 00:24:13,727
No.

535
00:24:14,174 --> 00:24:15,641
For Xander's sake, you can't take him

536
00:24:15,676 --> 00:24:17,643
back until it's cleared.

537
00:24:22,683 --> 00:24:24,488
Where am I supposed to go?

538
00:24:25,385 --> 00:24:27,420
I don't have anywhere else.

539
00:24:29,956 --> 00:24:31,991
Perhaps we could help.

540
00:24:51,144 --> 00:24:52,645
No lead.

541
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:53,879
Has your turned red anywhere?

542
00:24:53,914 --> 00:24:55,214
Nope.

543
00:24:55,248 --> 00:24:58,050
So we will have to test Xander's school

544
00:24:58,085 --> 00:25:00,219
and all of the parks
that he likes to play in.

545
00:25:00,253 --> 00:25:01,454
And by we, obviously I mean the city

546
00:25:01,488 --> 00:25:04,457
whose job this actually is.

547
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,127
Yeah, you good right there.

548
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:11,910
Let me see one of those swabs.

549
00:25:12,699 --> 00:25:14,967
Uh, okay.

550
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:21,474
Look. Lead.

551
00:25:22,943 --> 00:25:25,244
What are you, some sort of lead magician?

552
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:26,912
How did you know that?

553
00:25:26,947 --> 00:25:29,014
That overpass has been repainted.

554
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:31,016
They would've had to scrape
off all the older

555
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:32,718
layers of the lead paint.

556
00:25:32,753 --> 00:25:33,986
Oh, yeah.

557
00:25:35,355 --> 00:25:39,058
So if Xander's house
had exposure to lead,

558
00:25:39,092 --> 00:25:40,693
then so will all of his neighbors.

559
00:25:40,727 --> 00:25:42,858
And their neighbors.

560
00:25:45,365 --> 00:25:47,099
The city poisoned
this whole neighborhood.

561
00:25:56,318 --> 00:25:58,322
Still got time for that cut?

562
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,282
Hey, yo, doc, I thought I
made myself clear this morning.

563
00:26:00,316 --> 00:26:02,755
Yeah, no, you were. It's just a cut.

564
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,448
Nah, man.

565
00:26:04,482 --> 00:26:06,459
I had to spend the rest
of the day taking shots

566
00:26:06,493 --> 00:26:07,994
from everybody 'cause of you.

567
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,711
Sorry. I tend to have
that effect on people.

568
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,771
You know how hard I worked
to gain those people's trust?

569
00:26:14,796 --> 00:26:17,264
Hm? Make them feel safe?

570
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:21,025
Everybody who comes to my shop
has something to worry about.

571
00:26:21,242 --> 00:26:23,482
Their jobs, their family...

572
00:26:23,944 --> 00:26:25,778
and, yeah, their health
probably should be

573
00:26:25,813 --> 00:26:28,529
on that list, but people have
a hard enough time as it is.

574
00:26:29,283 --> 00:26:31,365
What if there's a way
to keep them safe...

575
00:26:31,645 --> 00:26:32,991
and healthy?

576
00:26:36,023 --> 00:26:37,724
You didn't come here for a cut, did you?

577
00:26:37,758 --> 00:26:40,994
Not really, no, 'cause
I really that your customers

578
00:26:41,028 --> 00:26:44,764
don't need some doctor from
the hospital down the street.

579
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:46,933
They need someone they trust and respect,

580
00:26:46,967 --> 00:26:48,468
someone they know has
their best interest at heart.

581
00:26:48,502 --> 00:26:50,508
- They need you.
- They already got me.

582
00:26:50,543 --> 00:26:53,072
Well, I'm thinking bigger, Kenny.

583
00:26:53,107 --> 00:26:55,975
I'm thinking you could be the one
keeping your community healthy.

584
00:27:00,214 --> 00:27:01,915
So, what, you want to make me a doctor?

585
00:27:05,953 --> 00:27:09,155
Look, how about you give me
that free cut...

586
00:27:09,189 --> 00:27:11,257
and we can talk?

587
00:27:15,296 --> 00:27:17,692
If I don't like your plan,
I'm charging full price.

588
00:27:17,726 --> 00:27:18,998
Deal.

589
00:27:20,163 --> 00:27:22,791
The defect is sub-aortal.

590
00:27:27,141 --> 00:27:28,274
Blood pressure.

591
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,487
Maintain monitoring.

592
00:27:30,522 --> 00:27:31,967
All right, suction.

593
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:35,788
Duke, what do you see?

594
00:27:37,629 --> 00:27:38,985
The left ventricle's dilated.

595
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:40,019
That's right.

596
00:27:40,054 --> 00:27:42,055
The heart wall's much thinner
than I expected.

597
00:27:42,089 --> 00:27:44,190
I'm gonna have to go slow and careful.

598
00:27:44,224 --> 00:27:46,059
Tell the scheduling nurse
we'll need more than two hours.

599
00:27:46,093 --> 00:27:47,327
How long will you need?

600
00:27:47,361 --> 00:27:50,063
Uh... six hours or more, and page Max.

601
00:27:50,097 --> 00:27:51,297
All right, let's go ahead and start

602
00:27:51,332 --> 00:27:53,299
the endoventricular circular plasty.

603
00:27:53,334 --> 00:27:55,301
You sure about that?

604
00:27:56,337 --> 00:27:58,838
Why not do the McCarthy technique?

605
00:28:03,824 --> 00:28:06,418
We'll do exactly as I said.

606
00:28:07,654 --> 00:28:08,721
Is that clear?

607
00:28:11,585 --> 00:28:13,319
Suction.

608
00:28:13,354 --> 00:28:15,021
Thank you for coming down, Mr. Laettner.

609
00:28:15,055 --> 00:28:16,889
Oh, Nathan. Nathan's fine.

610
00:28:16,924 --> 00:28:18,157
Good, good, good, you know,
it's not every day we have

611
00:28:18,192 --> 00:28:19,592
the Deputy Comptroller

612
00:28:19,626 --> 00:28:22,161
of the City of New York in our midst, so.

613
00:28:22,196 --> 00:28:24,330
We wish to speak with you
about the lead contamination

614
00:28:24,365 --> 00:28:26,065
in the local neighborhood.

615
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,901
Yes, you see, Nathan,
the Cross Bronx Expressway

616
00:28:28,936 --> 00:28:30,103
was built before 1972.

617
00:28:30,137 --> 00:28:31,604
I don't know if you're aware of that.

618
00:28:31,638 --> 00:28:33,272
And this is the part
that's just bananas to me.

619
00:28:33,307 --> 00:28:36,342
Back then, the city
only used lead-based paints.

620
00:28:36,377 --> 00:28:38,011
The city is fully aware
of that fact, Dr. Frome.

621
00:28:38,045 --> 00:28:39,045
Oh, are they?

622
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:41,914
Yeah, my office is actively
engaged in replacing

623
00:28:41,949 --> 00:28:44,666
all lead-based paints on public
works with safer alternatives.

624
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,020
Yeah, for which the city
is eternally grateful,

625
00:28:47,054 --> 00:28:49,288
but if your workers had done so properly,

626
00:28:49,323 --> 00:28:53,026
we wouldn't be here treating them.

627
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,551
Yeah.

628
00:28:54,586 --> 00:28:57,030
You see, Nathan, when the city workers

629
00:28:57,064 --> 00:29:00,066
were sandblasting the lead-based
paint off that overpass,

630
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,569
they must not
have sealed the blast zones.

631
00:29:03,603 --> 00:29:06,639
Toxic airborne particles
managed to pollute

632
00:29:06,673 --> 00:29:08,141
the entire neighborhood,

633
00:29:08,175 --> 00:29:10,610
every yard over a six-block stretch.

634
00:29:10,644 --> 00:29:13,046
So it appears your office
has a huge cleanup job

635
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,915
on your hands,
and a temporary housing crisis.

636
00:29:15,949 --> 00:29:17,283
You're probably gonna expect to cough up

637
00:29:17,317 --> 00:29:19,052
a pretty hefty settlement on this one.

638
00:29:21,288 --> 00:29:23,256
That lead could've come from anywhere.

639
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,926
Occupational exposure, food,
structures in the neighborhood,

640
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,261
they were all built before 1972.

641
00:29:28,295 --> 00:29:30,096
The city is not responsible
for this mess.

642
00:29:32,433 --> 00:29:34,901
And you have no proof
that says otherwise.

643
00:29:42,943 --> 00:29:44,277
He's seizing.

644
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,413
Push 2mg of ativan.

645
00:29:49,683 --> 00:29:51,606
Bloom?

646
00:29:55,956 --> 00:29:57,423
I'm fine. Get back to the patient.

647
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:59,258
- Just lean on me.
- No, I said I'm fine.

648
00:29:59,293 --> 00:30:00,670
Damnit, Lauren, just lean on me.

649
00:30:00,705 --> 00:30:02,295
I am fine.

650
00:30:09,236 --> 00:30:11,270
Lap pad.

651
00:30:15,709 --> 00:30:19,278
Tissue strength is lower than expected.

652
00:30:19,313 --> 00:30:20,446
How is he?

653
00:30:20,481 --> 00:30:22,315
He's fading, Max.

654
00:30:22,349 --> 00:30:24,283
I'm gonna be honest. So am I.

655
00:30:24,318 --> 00:30:26,119
Well, you want me to call
Flores so you can take a break?

656
00:30:26,153 --> 00:30:28,688
If I can get
a stitch to hold, I'd be done.

657
00:30:28,722 --> 00:30:30,022
Per the standardized calculations.

658
00:30:30,057 --> 00:30:32,058
The sutures just keep pulling through.

659
00:30:32,092 --> 00:30:34,193
I can't the walls of his heart together.

660
00:30:34,994 --> 00:30:36,962
How can I help? Say the word.

661
00:30:39,412 --> 00:30:41,179
You can prepare his daughter.

662
00:30:42,255 --> 00:30:43,955
In case.

663
00:30:44,071 --> 00:30:46,005
We'll leave nurses scrubbed in.

664
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,594
You wanted to see me?

665
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:58,017
Yes. Thank you, Jules.

666
00:31:04,391 --> 00:31:06,431
Molly, are you depressed?

667
00:31:07,113 --> 00:31:08,278
Depressed?

668
00:31:08,895 --> 00:31:10,038
No.

669
00:31:10,063 --> 00:31:13,396
I'm a lot of things,
but that's not one of them.

670
00:31:16,256 --> 00:31:19,925
Do you still find meaning in your life?

671
00:31:21,774 --> 00:31:22,807
No.

672
00:31:24,211 --> 00:31:28,414
And how would you describe
the quality of your life?

673
00:31:33,554 --> 00:31:35,388
Lacking...

674
00:31:35,422 --> 00:31:36,489
quality.

675
00:31:38,492 --> 00:31:40,560
Why are you asking me this?

676
00:31:54,206 --> 00:31:57,275
These are extremely powerful painkillers.

677
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:01,320
They're very good at what they do.

678
00:32:05,345 --> 00:32:08,013
But if you take too many of them,

679
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:10,078
your breathing will slow...

680
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,232
and you will die.

681
00:32:22,455 --> 00:32:24,676
I'm gonna leave the room now.

682
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:27,240
If they're gone when I return,

683
00:32:27,274 --> 00:32:29,275
there will be no questions asked.

684
00:32:38,852 --> 00:32:40,586
This is your choice.

685
00:32:42,195 --> 00:32:43,462
No one else's.

686
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:47,193
You're in control.

687
00:33:22,342 --> 00:33:24,069
Harmony, your...

688
00:33:25,178 --> 00:33:27,145
your dad needs a little more help,

689
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,573
and...

690
00:33:29,282 --> 00:33:31,350
it might be more than we can give.

691
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,868
Is there someone I can call for you?

692
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:40,359
No one but me and my dad.

693
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,632
Okay, well, I know that
waiting can be scary so...

694
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:49,268
if you need someone to talk to, I'm here.

695
00:33:49,302 --> 00:33:50,402
I'm fine.

696
00:33:53,206 --> 00:33:55,016
Okay, well...

697
00:33:56,342 --> 00:33:58,410
I'm just gonna sit here, too.

698
00:34:00,046 --> 00:34:01,246
If that's okay.

699
00:34:18,364 --> 00:34:21,133
I want to know exactly what
you said to Molly Richards.

700
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:22,794
Why? Has something happened?

701
00:34:23,403 --> 00:34:25,203
She checked out of the hospital

702
00:34:25,238 --> 00:34:29,134
after 16 months of working
tirelessly on her behalf.

703
00:34:29,623 --> 00:34:31,136
Where did she go?

704
00:34:32,078 --> 00:34:34,212
What did you say to my patient?

705
00:34:34,247 --> 00:34:37,215
Okay, first of all, Valentina,

706
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,217
she's not your patient.

707
00:34:39,252 --> 00:34:41,119
She is our patient.

708
00:34:41,154 --> 00:34:43,221
There are no sides in this department.

709
00:34:43,256 --> 00:34:45,057
But yes, I did speak with her.

710
00:34:45,091 --> 00:34:46,347
Of course, you did.

711
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:48,226
And I told her
that I thought you were doing

712
00:34:48,261 --> 00:34:49,916
an extraordinary job,

713
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:52,085
but if her pain had become too great,

714
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:53,887
I knew that you
would understand if she chose

715
00:34:53,921 --> 00:34:56,289
not to continue treatment,
because has a physician,

716
00:34:56,324 --> 00:34:58,544
there is no way
that you would put a drug trial

717
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:01,749
or scientific discovery ahead
of the needs of your patient.

718
00:35:02,964 --> 00:35:06,366
And I am certain
that she appreciated that.

719
00:35:09,637 --> 00:35:13,373
Next time one
of our patients has an issue,

720
00:35:13,407 --> 00:35:16,605
I promise be equally supportive of you.

721
00:35:26,287 --> 00:35:28,588
This is my last album.

722
00:35:28,623 --> 00:35:30,824
Oh, man, is that you?

723
00:35:30,858 --> 00:35:32,158
Look at you, you little tough guy.

724
00:35:32,193 --> 00:35:33,623
We're, like, four.

725
00:35:33,657 --> 00:35:34,995
Well, I don't care how old you are.

726
00:35:35,029 --> 00:35:36,229
Serving that attitude.

727
00:35:36,264 --> 00:35:38,999
Anything outside your house?

728
00:35:39,033 --> 00:35:40,600
Halloween, obviously.

729
00:35:40,635 --> 00:35:43,270
I love the wings.

730
00:35:43,304 --> 00:35:45,405
Oh, my God.

731
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:48,008
I don't even know what's happening here.

732
00:35:48,042 --> 00:35:50,410
They just grow up so fast.

733
00:35:50,444 --> 00:35:52,646
I been through so many albums.

734
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,510
My battery's dying.

735
00:35:55,149 --> 00:35:56,650
I don't think I'm gonna find anything.

736
00:35:56,684 --> 00:35:58,385
May I?

737
00:36:00,054 --> 00:36:02,255
I think you just did.

738
00:36:04,225 --> 00:36:05,438
Dr. Kapoor?

739
00:36:07,128 --> 00:36:10,163
This looks like proof to me.

740
00:36:18,906 --> 00:36:21,041
Oh, hey, Andy.

741
00:36:21,075 --> 00:36:22,042
Where's Ligon?

742
00:36:22,076 --> 00:36:23,681
Dr. Ligon's on vacation.

743
00:36:24,312 --> 00:36:25,979
Are you serious?

744
00:36:26,013 --> 00:36:28,253
I thought he went down
to the ED to tell you.

745
00:36:29,383 --> 00:36:30,650
Would you like to see Dr. Parsons?

746
00:36:30,685 --> 00:36:31,952
She's also a miracle worker.

747
00:36:31,986 --> 00:36:33,320
No.

748
00:36:33,354 --> 00:36:34,421
Thank you.

749
00:36:42,196 --> 00:36:43,263
Ella.

750
00:36:45,399 --> 00:36:46,466
Ella.

751
00:36:49,437 --> 00:36:52,472
I can't stop thinking about the big news.

752
00:36:52,506 --> 00:36:55,175
- Vijay...
- Don't Vijay me.

753
00:36:55,209 --> 00:36:56,476
We are a family now.

754
00:36:58,112 --> 00:36:59,446
You haven't told anyone, have you?

755
00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:03,116
Of course not.

756
00:37:04,418 --> 00:37:06,553
Okay. Um...

757
00:37:08,356 --> 00:37:10,991
Because I am not sure if I'm keeping it.

You wanted to see me?

00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,367
This is my OR.

783
00:39:01,402 --> 00:39:03,336
Everything I do here is for a reason.

784
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,271
It works for me.

785
00:39:05,306 --> 00:39:07,440
Now out there on the floor is
a loving, peaceful democracy,

786
00:39:07,475 --> 00:39:09,142
but in there,
it's full-blown dictatorship.

787
00:39:09,176 --> 00:39:10,543
You got it?

788
00:39:10,578 --> 00:39:13,113
- Understood.
- I didn't say you can go.

789
00:39:21,422 --> 00:39:23,223
Run down the McCarthy technique.

790
00:39:23,257 --> 00:39:25,012
Top to bottom.

791
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,490
Yes, sir.

792
00:39:28,162 --> 00:39:30,296
You start by opening the IV apex

793
00:39:30,331 --> 00:39:32,565
at least 1.5cm from the LAD.

794
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,400
Then, using a purse string suture,

795
00:39:34,435 --> 00:39:37,203
you pull together the damaged
left ventricular wall.

796
00:39:37,872 --> 00:39:40,384
- Hi.
- We need to talk right now.

797
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,175
I see you heard about
our plan to sue the city

798
00:39:42,209 --> 00:39:43,409
over lead contamination.

799
00:39:43,444 --> 00:39:44,477
What? No.

800
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:45,478
What?

801
00:39:45,513 --> 00:39:47,313
Oh, then, never mind.

802
00:39:47,348 --> 00:39:48,515
I'm here because I heard
about your little plan

803
00:39:48,549 --> 00:39:50,150
with the barber.

804
00:39:50,184 --> 00:39:51,237
Oh, yeah. Pretty cool, right?

805
00:39:51,272 --> 00:39:53,253
- No, no, not cool.
- Not cool?

806
00:39:53,287 --> 00:39:55,321
No, I'm just training
a barber at Kenny's Kuts

807
00:39:55,356 --> 00:39:57,545
to check his customer's blood pressure.

808
00:39:58,144 --> 00:40:00,112
- That's it?
- Yeah.

809
00:40:00,137 --> 00:40:03,138
Mostly. Here me out.

810
00:40:03,262 --> 00:40:06,499
<i>Kenny sees people once a week in
a relaxed and trusted environment.</i>

811
00:40:06,534 --> 00:40:08,434
<i>You couldn't ask for a better
monitoring situation,</i>

812
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:12,272
<i>and if anyone exceeds
140/90 for over four weeks...</i>

813
00:40:12,306 --> 00:40:15,108
<i>The barber is diagnosing hypertension</i>

814
00:40:15,142 --> 00:40:17,343
and dispensing prescription meds?

815
00:40:17,378 --> 00:40:18,611
With my oversight.

816
00:40:18,646 --> 00:40:20,091
What oversight? You're not there.

817
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,214
You're here.

818
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,183
Kenny has a detailed checklist to follow.

819
00:40:23,217 --> 00:40:26,386
So do Legos, but no one's
life depends on them.

820
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,354
I mean, what if mistakes are made?

821
00:40:28,389 --> 00:40:31,457
There's a built-in system
of checks and balances

822
00:40:31,492 --> 00:40:33,393
that I'll be carefully supervising,

823
00:40:33,427 --> 00:40:34,694
and, sure, there's some risk,

824
00:40:34,728 --> 00:40:36,596
but Kenny and the others
will be saving lives.

825
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,464
- Just imagine...
- Wait, wait, stop.

826
00:40:38,499 --> 00:40:40,300
What others? You said others?

827
00:40:40,334 --> 00:40:42,235
Yeah. So far I've enlisted
seven barber shops,

828
00:40:42,269 --> 00:40:44,637
and I'm trying for more.

829
00:40:44,672 --> 00:40:47,307
Max, what you're doing is decentralizing

830
00:40:47,341 --> 00:40:49,475
and de-professionalizing healthcare.

831
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,944
Exactly.

832
00:40:50,978 --> 00:40:52,478
<i>There's no reason that healthcare</i>

833
00:40:52,513 --> 00:40:54,380
<i>has to be delivered in a hospital.</i>

834
00:40:54,415 --> 00:40:56,249
<i>In fact, patients are best
served in an environment</i>

835
00:40:56,283 --> 00:40:57,650
<i>where they're made comfortable</i>

836
00:40:57,685 --> 00:41:00,153
<i>by trusted members
of their own community.</i>

837
00:41:00,187 --> 00:41:03,656
<i>Hospitals have to go
meet patients where they live,</i>

838
00:41:03,691 --> 00:41:05,391
<i>not the other way around.</i>

839
00:41:05,426 --> 00:41:07,660
So in your idealized world,

840
00:41:07,695 --> 00:41:10,430
there are zero patients at New Amsterdam?

841
00:41:10,464 --> 00:41:11,531
Ideally.

842
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,400
Yeah.

843
00:41:14,435 --> 00:41:16,469
